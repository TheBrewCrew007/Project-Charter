Consumers lose track of the beverages they collect which can often lead to the drinks expiring, or sitting on the shelf
untouched for years. This is often the case for consumers who are fond of collecting drinks such as rare beer or 
fancy wine. This can lead to a substantial loss of money, time, and shelf space. Therefore, we have decided to create a 
project which can manage the inventory of drinks which a particular consumer owns, allowing them to customize their collection
on the app and create/delete shelves as needed. The app will send notifications to the user to notify them in advance if any
 drink is about to expire. Our app will be android based and will be accessible to the general public to organize their shelves.
We expect to finish with minimum expenditure while satisfying a higher number of objectives.
