Our project is a software-based project therefore, the equipment used will be our personal desktops and laptops. 
The team concluded that no other exterior hardware product will be needed. However, in terms of software our team 
will be needing various development tools. 
\\
The team will be using Barcode scanner API, which will help our software to successfully identify products
 through barcode. Firebase is another such tool that our team will be using for realtime database, cloud 
 messaging and user login authentication. There are free versions available in the market for both Barcode 
 scanner API and Firebase but, the free versions come with limitations such as limited amount of storage space
  for Firebase and limited number of barcode scans for the barcode API. Therefore, the team may need to use the 
  provided funds to access the additional features.
