The app will be used to manage a vast quantity of beverage items. The main priority of the app will be to 
properly manage the inventory which is scanned by the user. Additionally, for the first delivery, 
the app should support android and iOS based applications which will have access to the camera. 
Further features, such as, notifications, sounds, animations, and data will be added after the initial delivery.
The final app should be able to store the read, interpret and store the beverage information in shelves (which will be added by the user) 
and send notifications to the user about expiry dates amongst other information.

After the beverage is scanned:
\begin{itemize}
  \item notifications will be issued
  \item space limit will be monitored
\end{itemize}
