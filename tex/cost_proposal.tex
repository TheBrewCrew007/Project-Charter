Our project is supported and sponsored by the CSE department of University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). 
Approximately \$800 will be provided to us to help our team with completion of the project. However, the team 
will need to provide valid proof of the expenses in order to be funded. Our team prioritizes on delivering a 
smooth working software with minimum cost. Therefore, expenses that our team can think of is accessing the 
global online alcohol inventory database through barcode. Through online research, we found out that there 
are multiple pricing depending on the package we want to buy. Therefore, the exact cost of purchase is yet 
to be finalized. Another expense that our project might include is accessing the features of Firebase.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
Our team aims to deliver a working software with minimum expenses. Currently, there are no pending supports 
for this project. However, our team is confident that the extra expenses related to the project can be covered 
by the \$800 funding provided by the CSE department.
