There many beverage inventory management apps in different platforms available currently in the market. 
Partender, Barkeep, Orca Inventory \& Ordering and Accubar are among the top results. These applications are 
commercially used in bars, restaurants and retail stores.  

 Firstly, Partender is the application genuinely indented for smart phones, android and iOS. According to their 
 website their clients can save up to  \$10,000 per month \cite{buzztime} . It's a basic application where 
 it tries to keep track of amount of beverage it has in the stock by just taking the picture of the bottle and 
 swiping the level of content, company's motto "Tap-Swipe-Done". The application also helps to order more 
 beverage and can track the most sellers and dead stocks currently in the system \cite{accubar}.

Another interesting application is Accubar, according to the website, "We have taken tried and true beverage 
management methods and automated them, using fast, sturdy bar-code scanners to save labor, eliminate error points
 and drive loss prevention and accountability" \cite{partender}.  Products other features includes, inventory 
 counts, receiving, perpetual inventory, supplier ordering, transfers between locations, empties, etc. 

The solutions exist, however at some large scale and including other unnecessary features (transferring beverages,
 supplier ordering etc.). Being so used commercially has its price demand with Partender ended up for \$165 per 
 month \cite{partender}, Barkeep for \$40-50 per month and Accubar's pricing is not mentioned by the vendor 
 \cite{eicher}. Orca Inventory \& Ordering has inventory tracking and control, budgeting tools, and one click 
 ordering system \cite{orca}, which seems too commercials as compared to our client's personal need.
