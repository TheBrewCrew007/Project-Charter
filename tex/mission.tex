Our team aims to develop a well-managed and easy to navigate application for managing
alcoholic beverage. Apart from easy navigation, we aim to develop a systematic way of keeping
tabs of the inventory with maximum accuracy. Through our application, users will be able to
successfully track and categorize the alcohol products they have. Our application provides a
chance for the users track the financial losses that may have occurred by accidental damage or
theft of a product. Our product aims to attract individuals who love collecting variety of alcohol
product, alcohol beverage companies and businesses that sell alcohol.
