\\
The team members are Bishal Paudel, Kunal Samant, Nirjal Phaiju, Sima Ryamajhi, and Lokendra B. Chhetri. As Miyamoto Musashi said, "Fixation is the way to death. Fluidity is the way to life." So, to give life to this project, we decided to gyrate our Scrum Master and team leader in every phase. Initially, we decided to appoint Kunal as a team lead and Scrum Master as Dr. Conly.
\\
For this phase, Kunal and Nirjal will be working on Backend whereas Bishal and Lokendra will work on GUIs and frontend. Sima will work as a risk management lead. As a team, we will be giving 100{\%} on the tasks we are assigned and also helping each other out.
